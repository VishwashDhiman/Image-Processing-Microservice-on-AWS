While testing, some of the image URLS like https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Golden_tabby_and_white_kitten_n01.jpg was not working. 
I took help from knowledge articles [link-1](https://knowledge.udacity.com/questions/666666), [link-2](https://knowledge.udacity.com/questions/382272). 
Then I tested the endpoint using other image urls [Working-image-url-1](https://clipart.info/images/ccovers/1516943361superman-logo-hd-png-img.png), 
[Working-image-url-2](https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/2ecd3e90-2811-11eb-bf2e-a5ff0cfc4b94).
